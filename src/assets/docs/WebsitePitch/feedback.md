# Feedback on Our Website Pitch

Simple but interesting idea. 

Great slides, with several mock-ups, and it was a good thought to match the UL colour palette. One of the best presentations.

For the back-end, it was an interesting feature of recommendations of possible places for meet-ups on campus, potential date ideas and upcoming community events.

Regards,
Allan
