Great work, but as discussed during the meeting, the website has a few bugs/limitations related to the register and search functionalities. The way to register hobbies in a single line is not good, and the search using "looking for" is not working.

Just fix those, and focus on implementing the remaining functionalities for the final demo.

Regards,

Allan
